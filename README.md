# Image representation as ascii characters

## Introduction:
Hey! I wanted to share a program with you that can create ASCII art. ASCII art has been around for a long time, and there are many other implementations available. However, I've created my own implementation using Python and OpenCV.

## Installation:
To get started, here's what you need to do:

1. __Install pipenv:__
   You can find the documentation for installing pipenv on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/).

2. __Install the required packages:__
   First, download the project into a folder of your choice. Then, open a terminal and run the command <code>pipenv install</code>. This will download all the necessary packages for the project. Once the installation is complete, enter the virtual environment shell by executing <code>pipenv shell</code>.

3. __Run the program:__
   Now, navigate to the same folder where you downloaded the project. In the terminal, type <code>python main.py</code>. The program will prompt you to provide a path to a directory. This path can either be a link (URL) to an image or a regular system path.

That's it! You're all set to create ASCII art using my program. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
