# Image representation as ascii characters

## Introduction:
Hey! I wanted to share a program with you that can create ASCII art. ASCII art has been around for a long time, and there are many other implementations available. However, I've created my own implementation using Python and OpenCV.

## Installation:
To get started, here's what you need to do:

1. Install pipenv:
   You can find the documentation for installing pipenv on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/).

2. Install the required packages:
   First, download the project into a folder of your choice. Then, open a terminal and run the command "pipenv install". This will download all the necessary packages for the project. Once the installation is complete, enter the virtual environment shell by executing "pipenv shell".

3. Run the program:
   Now, navigate to the same folder where you downloaded the project. In the terminal, type "python main.py". The program will prompt you to provide a path to a directory. This path can either be a link (URL) to an image or a regular system path.

That's it! You're all set to create ASCII art using my program. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
